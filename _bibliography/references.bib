  abstract = {O livro “Arquitectura Popular. Tradição e Vanguarda”, propõe uma sistematização historiográfica, uma reflexão teórica e uma abordagem contemporânea da arquitectura popular, num abrangente arco temporal de finais do século XIX a finais do século XX, colocando em paralelo e em confronto Portugal e Espanha, inseridos no contexto Europeu. A atenção e o foco centrado na arquitectura popular, parte integrante da cultura arquitectónica nacional em cada momento, insere-se num contexto mais vasto, de valorização da geografia como matriz, de propaganda das diferentes regiões nacionais, de valorização do mundo rural, e da construção de uma imagética iconográfica de um passado, tudo em prol de definição de um carácter nacional.  Os olhares, as leituras, e as interpretações do mundo popular levadas a cabo por antropólogos, etnólogos, geógrafos, engenheiros agrónomos, e arquitectos, permitem posicionar o popular como uma plataforma entre o tradicional e o moderno, oscilando entre uma manipulação dirigida pelo poder, e uma alternativa desejada pela vanguarda. Os conceitos operativos são normalmente colocados em confronto nas mais diversas variantes: tradição vs modernidade; nacional vs internacional; verdadeiro vs supérfluo; academismo vs vanguardismo; erudito vs vernáculo. O livro procura assim desenvolver um exercício de história comparada, como reflexão conjunta de problemas que foram comuns e singulares, e que caracterizaram o debate e a cultura arquitectónica de ambos os países.},

  abstract = {Critical Perspectives on Cultural Memory and Heritage focuses on the importance of memory and heritage for individual and group identity, and for their sense of belonging. It aims to expose the motives and discourses related to the destruction of memory and heritage during times of war, terror, sectarian conflict and through capitalist policies. It is within these affected spheres of cultural heritage where groups and communities ascribe values, develop memories, and shape their collective identity.Chapters in the volume address cultural memory and heritage from six global perspectives and contexts: first, the relationship between cultural memory and heritage; second, the effect of urban development and large infrastructure on heritage; third, the destruction of indigenous heritage; fourth, the destruction of heritage in relation to erasing memory during sectarian violence and conflict; fifth, the impact of policymaking on cultural heritage assets; and sixth, a broad reflection on the destruction, change and transformation of heritage in an epilogue by Cornelius Holtorf, archaeologist and Chair of Heritage Futures at UNESCO.        The range of sites discussed in the volume – from Australia, Brazil and Syria, to Bosnia, the UK and Taiwan – make it essential reading for researchers in Museum and Heritage Studies, Archaeology and History seeking a global, comprehensive study of cultural memory and heritage.},

This paper examines the role of urban regeneration in revitalizing redundant historic areas and how they can be used to reinforce their cities urban identities. This study is based on the case study approach by focusing on the urban regeneration of Msheireb in old Doha, Qatar. Since the project is not yet completed, this paper will focus on the physical aspects of urban identity rather than its social dimensions. The empirical investigation used a comprehensive fieldwork undertaken through several site visits. This paper argues that one way of rediscovering the urban identity of the city of Doha is to go back to its first roots and try to sustain them in face of the emerging global environments. Through the Msheireb urban regeneration project, this paper explores a new experience in Qatar and the Gulf in creating a new urban identity inspired from the past.},

Despite the fact that Portugal is a small country, there are many different architectural approaches and a range of techniques have been employed in different regions to mitigate the effects of climate. These vernacular approaches have the potential for further development and could be adapted in response to contemporary needs. In this paper, a range of different passive solar techniques used in Portuguese vernacular architecture to provide comfort is presented. The specific focus is on the effectiveness of passive cooling strategies (namely, high thermal inertia, use of light colours and courtyards), and the findings of a case study in which the thermal performance during the summer of a vernacular residential building located in the south of Portugal are presented.},

In the eighteenth century, this architecture made the romantic ideals of rural society synonymous with its surroundings, territory and country. In the twentieth century, a select few modernist intellectuals carried out in-depth studies of this architectural type in relation to its formal values. Now, in the twenty-first century, it has become the object of technological and scientific analysis for many experts. The current situation still presents many unresolved problems, which are perhaps the result of little thought having been put into specific aspects of the process of vernacular architecture.},

Assessing and managing future impacts of climate change on poverty requires different metrics, and specific studies focusing on the vulnerability of poor people. This special issue provides a set of such studies, looking at the exposure and vulnerability of people living in poverty to shocks and stressors that are expected to increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change, such as floods, droughts, heat waves, and impacts on agricultural production and ecosystem services. This introduction summarizes their approach and findings, which support the idea that the link between poverty and climate vulnerability goes both ways: poverty is one major driver of people's vulnerability to climate-related shocks and stressors, and this vulnerability is keeping people in poverty. The paper concludes by identifying priorities for future research.},

The ideology of modernism, which remains the foundation for the educational philosophy in most architectural schools, is too closely linked with the forces of positivism, idealism and rationalism to respond adequately to the traditional cultural patterns of society. Yet, it is generally felt that it is modernist ideology which pulls us into the future by setting new standards and destroying old icons. In a pluralist and democratic society students of architecture should be equipped with strategies for design which are informed by the ideologies of modernism and traditionalism and with the ability to make judgments as to their appropriate uses.},

  abstract = {Abstract: By combining daily (operations) and embodied energy demands, this work estimates life-cycle energy demands for residents and workers in different city settings. Using life-cycle analyses (LCAs) of different neighborhood types in Austin, Texas, this analysis fabricates five different city types, reflecting actual accessibility and resident and employment density profiles. Five residential and three commercial neighborhood types are distributed across 16-kilometer (10-mile) radius regions, with demographics held constant, for comparability. As expected, per-capita daily energy demands decrease with increased resident and employment density. Interestingly, embodied energy savings via increases in density are substantial. Though embodied energy makes up only 10-20 percent of total life-cycle energy, per-capita savings via density suggest it should be included in planning analyses. Overall, average life-cycle per-capita energy use ranges from 140 gigajoule (GJ)/year/capita in the least dense Orlando-style setting to around 90 GJ/year/capita in the maximum-density scenario, corresponding to a 35 percent reduction in per-capita energy demand. Energy reductions for Phoenix, Austin, and Seattle settings (relative to an Orlando-based design) are 18, 22, and 24 percent per-capita, respectively. Results provide a rare view of how total annual energy demands in both residential and commercial sectors are affected by density.},

  abstract = {Buildings are major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributors to the climate crisis. To meet climate-change mitigation needs, one must go beyond operational energy consumption and related GHG emissions of buildings and address their full life cycle. This study investigates the global trends of GHG emissions arising across the life cycle of buildings by systematically compiling and analysing more than 650 life cycle assessment (LCA) case studies. The results, presented for different energy performance classes based on a final sample of 238 cases, show a clear reduction trend in life cycle GHG emissions due to improved operational energy performance. However, the analysis reveals an increase in relative and absolute contributions of so‐called ‘embodied’ GHG emissions, i.e., emissions arising from manufacturing and processing of building materials. While the average share of embodied GHG emissions from buildings following current energy performance regulations is approximately 20–25\% of life cycle GHG emissions, this figure escalates to 45–50\% for highly energy-efficient buildings and surpasses 90\% in extreme cases. Furthermore, this study analyses GHG emissions at time of occurrence, highlighting the ‘carbon spike’ from building production. Relating the results to existing benchmarks for buildings’ GHG emissions in the Swiss SIA energy efficiency path shows that most cases exceed the target of 11.0 kgCO2eq/m2a. Considering global GHG reduction targets, these results emphasize the urgent need to reduce GHG emissions of buildings by optimizing both operational and embodied impacts. The analysis further confirmed a need for improving transparency and comparability of LCA studies.},

  abstract = {What is obsolescence? Numerous older buildings have been demolished due to being labelled as obsolete. There is a general understanding that buildings, similar to machinery and durable consumer goods, should be demolished and replaced when they become obsolete. The truth of this assertion is examined and found to be problematic, as obsolescence is not clearly understood in conceptual or practical terms. Obsolescence presents a serious threat to built property as it rarely accounts for the immobile, long-lasting and (financial and natural resource) capital-intensive characteristics of property, nor for its societal and cultural significance. Minimizing obsolescence and extending longevity are therefore indispensable for maintaining the physical, economic and societal investments. The characteristics and symptoms of obsolescence are explored specifically to address how buildings can be diagnosed and when and to what extent is demolition an unavoidable consequence. A theoretical/conceptual model is developed which allows for different kinds of obsolescence to be characterized and distinguished. The model distinguishes between physical and behavioural factors and between endogenous and exogenous factors. It also accounts for the often inverse relation between the increase of complexity of types of obsolescence and the decrease of the owner's possibilities to manage it. Through the provision of an interrelational approach, the model explains why obsolescence occurs and it can be used as a basis for structuring an evidence base on obsolescence. Qu'est-ce que l'obsolescence? De nombreux bâtiments anciens ont été démolis parce qu'ils ont été catalogués comme dépassés. L'opinion générale considère que les bâtiments, étant similaires aux machines et aux biens de consommation durables, devraient être démolis et remplacés lorsqu'ils deviennent dépassés. La vérité de cette affirmation est examinée et il est constaté qu'elle pose problème, car l'obsolescence n'est pas clairement comprise en des termes conceptuels ou pratiques. L'obsolescence pose une menace sérieuse aux biens immobiliers bâtis dans la mesure où elle rend rarement compte des caractéristiques immobiles, durables et capitalistiques (en termes de ressources financières et naturelles) d'un bien immobilier, ni de sa signification sociétale et culturelle. Il est par conséquent indispensable de réduire au minimum l'obsolescence et de prolonger la longévité afin de préserver les investissements physiques, économiques et sociétaux. Les caractéristiques et les symptômes de l'obsolescence sont examinés précisément de manière à répondre à la question de savoir comment les bâtiments peuvent être diagnostiqués, ainsi qu'à quel moment et dans quelle mesure la démolition devient une conséquence inévitable. Il est développé un modèle théorique/conceptuel qui permet de caractériser et de distinguer différents types d'obsolescence. Ce modèle fait la distinction entre les facteurs physiques et comportementaux et entre les facteurs endogènes et exogènes. Il rend également compte de la relation souvent inverse entre l'accroissement de la complexité des types d'obsolescence et la réduction des possibilités de gestion de celle-ci par le propriétaire. En fournissant une approche interrelationnelle, le modèle explique pourquoi l'obsolescence survient et il est possible de s'appuyer sur celui-ci pour structurer une base de données probantes sur l'obsolescence.

  abstract = {Energy consumption and pollutant emissions from buildings have caused serious impacts on the environment. Currently, research on building environmental costs is quite insufficient. Based on life cycle inventory of building materials, fossil fuel and electricity power, a calculating model for environmental costs during different stages is presented. A single-objective optimization model is generated by converting environmental impact into environmental cost, with the same unit with direct cost. Two residential buildings, one located in Beijing and another in Xiamen, China, are taken as the case studies and analyzed to test the proposed model. Moreover, data uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of key parameters, including the discount rate and the unit virtual abatement costs of pollutants, are also conducted. The analysis results show that the environmental cost accounts for about 16\% of direct cost. The environmental degradation cost accounts for about 70\% of the total environmental cost. According to the probabilistic uncertainty analysis results, the coefficient of variation of material production stage is the largest. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the unit virtual abatement cost of CO2 has the largest influence on the final environmental cost.},
